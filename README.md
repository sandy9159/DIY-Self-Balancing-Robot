Hello friends this post is about DIY self balancing robot in this post Iâ€™ll show how you can build your own Self balancing robot.
I have tried to build the project but failed not get results as expected.but this robot turn out quite good and accurate, though this is not perfect but best as compare to my previous bots.

I have use a custom made PCB, Arduno nano, MPU6050, A4988 driver, HC-05 bt module, MDF board and some hardware to build this self balancing robot,detail material list you can found further in this post.Balancingwii firmware and EZ-GUI android app is used in this project to control robot via Bluetooth connection.

I have prepare a PCB also you can download the Gerber file to order PCB or you can also edit the PCB in easyeda platform.https://easyeda.com/sharmaz747/self-balancing

I have order this PCB from https://jlcpcb.com/ there is a good reason to choose JLCPCB as PCB partner is firth they are providing high quality PCB in affordable price and second they have very fast manufacturing time so you get PCB in very short time.

I suggest you if you have any PCB need kindly check out https://jlcpcb.com/
